`1` Install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/)

`2` Open a command prompt and install the dependencies needed for the tool by pasting the commands below
```sh
pip install discord
```
```sh
pip install colorama
```

`3` After doing that, download the repo as ZIP from the green Code button, and extract it.

`4` Run the main.py file and input your bot token in the prompt. Make sure the bot is in the server.

# What makes it better then other nukers on Github?
Other nukers are skidded and include HVNC strings in them, (which rats you) while Exodus V2 is open-source and written in python, easy to use and understand.
We do not include malicious code against the user.
Bypasses Discord rate-limit by sending a mass spam first, and then continuing to not go over the rate-limit.

### It would be appreciated if you would star this as it would help me
